               Guidelines for Defining Packet Timestamps
               draft-mizrahi-intarea-packet-timestamps-00

Abstract

   This document specifies guidelines for defining binary packet
   timestamp formats in networking protocols at various layers.  It also
   presents three recommended timestamp formats.  The target audience of
   this memo includes network protocol designers.  It is expected that a
   new network protocol that requires a packet timestamp will, in most
   cases, use one of the recommended timestamp formats.  If none of the
   recommended formats fits the protocol requirements, the new protocol
   specification should specify the format of the packet timestamp
   according to the guidelines in this document.

1.  Introduction

   Timestamps are widely used in network protocols for various purposes,
   including delay measurement, clock synchronization, and logging or
   reporting the time of an event.

   Timestamps are represented in the RFC series in one of two forms:
   text-based timestamps, and packet timestamps.  Text-based timestamps
   [RFC3339] are represented as user-friendly strings, and are widely
   used in the RFC series, for example in information objects and data
   models, e.g., [RFC5646], [RFC6991], and [RFC7493].  Packet
   timestamps, on the other hand, are represented by a compact binary
   field that has a fixed size, and are not intended to have a human-
   friendly format.  Packet timestamps are also very common in the RFC
   series, and are used for example for measuring delay and for
   synchronizing clocks, e.g., [RFC5905], [RFC4656], and [RFC1323].

   This memo presents guidelines for defining a packet timestamp format
   in network protocols.  Three recommended timestamp formats are
   presented.  It is expected that a new network protocol that requires

   a packet timestamp will, in most cases, use one of the recommended
   timestamp formats.  If none of the recommended formats fits the
   protocol requirements, the new protocol specification should specify
   the format of the packet timestamp according to the guidelines in
   this document.

2.  Terminology

2.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

2.2.  Abbreviations

   NTP         Network Time Protocol [RFC5905]

   PTP         Precision Time Protocol [IEEE1588]

3.  Packet Timestamp Format Specification

   This section defines a template for specifying packet timestamp
   formats.  A timestamp format specification MUST include the following
   aspects:

   Timestamp field format:

      The format of the timestamp field consists of:

      + Size: The number of bits (or octets) used to represent the
      packet timestamp field.

      + Units: The units used to represent the timestamp.

      If the timestamp is comprised of more than one field, the format
      of each field is specified.

   Epoch:

      The origin of the timescale used for the timestamp; the moment in
      time used as a reference for the timestamp value.

   Wraparound:

      The wraparound period of the timestamp.  Any further wraparound-
      related considerations should be described here.

Internet-Draft              Packet Timestamps                  June 2017


   Synchronization aspects:

      Any assumptions or requirements related to synchronization should
      be specified, for example, whether it is assumed that nodes
      populating the timestamps should be synchronized, and whether the
      timestamp is measured with respect to a central reference clock
      such as a stratum 1 NTP server.

4.  Recommended Timestamp Formats

   This memo recommends to use one of the three timestamp formats
   specified below.  In cases where the three timestamp formats below do
   not satisfy the protocol requirements, the timestamp specification
   should clearly state the reasons for defining a new format.

   Clearly, different network protocols (and the use cases they serve)
   may have different requirements and constraints, and consequently may
   use different timestamp formats.  The choice of the specific
   timestamp format for a given protocol may depend on a various
   factors.  A few examples of factors that may affect the choice of the
   timestamp format:

   o  Timestamp size: while some network protocols may allow a large
      timestamp fields, in other cases there may be constraints with
      respect to the timestamp size, affecting the choice of the
      timestamp format.

   o  Resolution: the time resolution is another factor that may
      directly affect the selected timestamp format.  Similarly, the
      wraparound periodicity of the timestamp may also affect the
      selected format.

   o  Common format for multiple protocols: if there are two or more
      network protocols that use timestamps and are often used together
      in typical systems, using a common timestamp format should be
      preferred if possible.

4.1.  NTP Timestamp Formats

4.1.1.  NTP 64-bit Timestamp Format

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) 64-bit timestamp format is defined in
   [RFC5905].  This timestamp format is used in several network
   protocols, including [RFC6374], [RFC4656], and [RFC5357].  Since this
   timestamp format is used in NTP, this timestamp format should be
   preferred in network protocols that are typically deployed in concert
   with NTP.

   The format is presented in this section according to the template
   defined in Section 3.

              Figure 1: NTP [RFC5905] 64-bit Timestamp Format

   Timestamp field format:

      Seconds: specifies the integer portion of the number of seconds
      since the epoch.

      + Size: 32 bits.

      + Units: seconds.

      Fraction: specifies the fractional portion of the number of
      seconds since the epoch.

      + Size: 32 bits.

      + Units: the unit is 2^(-32) seconds, which is roughly equal to
      233 picoseconds.

   Epoch:

      The epoch is 1 January 1900 at 00:00 UTC.

   Wraparound:

      This time format wraps around every 2^32 seconds, which is roughly
      136 years.  The next wraparound will occur in the year 2036.

   Synchronization aspects:

      The timestamp format itself does not place a requirement on the
      degree of synchronization between nodes; such requirements emerge
      from the protocol and use cases served.  Note that if the nodes
      that use this timestamp format use NTP-based synchronization, the
      timestamp may be derived from the NTP-synchronized clock, allowing

      the timestamp to be measured with respect to the clock of an NTP
      server.

4.1.2.  NTP 32-bit Timestamp Format

   The Network Time Protocol (NTP) 32-bit timestamp format is defined in
   [RFC5905].  This timestamp format is used in
   [I-D.morton-ippm-mbm-registry].  This timestamp format should be
   preferred in network protocols that are typically deployed in concert
   with NTP.  The 32-bit format can be used either when space
   constraints do not allow the use of the 64-bit format, or when the
   32-bit format satisfies the resolution and wraparound requirements.

   The format is presented in this section according to the template
   defined in Section 3.


        0                   1                   2                   3

      since the epoch.

      + Size: 16 bits.

      + Units: seconds.

      Fraction: specifies the fractional portion of the number of
      seconds since the epoch.

      + Size: 16 bits.

      + Units: the unit is 2^(-16) seconds, which is roughly equal to
      15.3 microseconds.

   Epoch:

      The epoch is 1 January 1900 at 00:00 UTC.

   Wraparound:

      This time format wraps around every 2^16 seconds, which is roughly
      18 hours.

   Synchronization aspects:

      The timestamp format itself does not place a requirement on the
      degree of synchronization between nodes; such requirements emerge
      from the protocol and use cases served.  Note that if the nodes
      that use this timestamp format use NTP-based synchronization, the
      timestamp may be derived from the NTP-synchronized clock, allowing
      the timestamp to be measured with respect to the clock of an NTP
      server.

4.2.  The PTP Concatenated Timestamp Format

   The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) [IEEE1588] uses an 80-bit timestamp
   format.  The concatenated timestamp format is a 64-bit field, which
   is the 64 least significant bits of the 80-bit PTP timestamp.  Since
   this timestamp format is similar to the one used in PTP, this
   timestamp format should be preferred in network protocols that are
   typically deployed in PTP-capable devices.

   The PTP concatenated timestamp format is used in several protocols,
   such as [RFC6374], [RFC7456], [RFC8186] and [ITU-T-Y.1731].


        0                   1                   2                   3

       +-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+

      since the epoch.

      + Size: 32 bits.

      + Units: seconds.

      Nanoseconds: specifies the fractional portion of the number of
      seconds since the epoch.

      + Size: 32 bits.

      + Units: nanoseconds.  The value of this field is in the range 0
      to (10^9)-1.

   Epoch:

      The PTP [IEEE1588] epoch is 1 January 1970 00:00:00 TAI, which is
      31 December 1969 23:59:51.999918 UTC.

   Wraparound:

      This time format wraps around every 2^32 seconds, which is roughly
      136 years.  The next wraparound will occur in the year 2106.

   Synchronization aspects:

      The timestamp format itself does not place a requirement on the
      degree of synchronization between nodes; such requirements emerge
      from the protocol and use cases served.  Note that if the nodes
      that use this timestamp format use PTP-based synchronization, the
      timestamp may be derived from the PTP-synchronized clock, allowing
      the timestamp to be measured with respect to the clock of an PTP
      Grandmaster clock.

5.  Packet Timestamp Control Field

   In some cases it is desirable to have a control field that includes
   information about the timestamp format.  This section defines a
   recommended format of a timestamp-related control field that is
   intended for network protocols that require such timestamp-related
   control information.

   The recommended control field includes the following sub-fields:

   o  Timestamp format.

   o  Precision - the resolution or granularity of the system clock.

   o  Epoch.

   o  Era - the number of times the time has wrapped around since the
      epoch.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

7.  Security Considerations

   A network protocol that uses a packet timestamp MUST specify the
   security considerations that result from using the timestamp.  This
   section provides an overview of some of the common security
   considerations of using timestamps.

   Any metadata that is attached to control or data packets, and
   specifically packet timestamps, can facilitate network
   reconnaissance; by passively eavesdropping to timestamped packets an
   attacker can gather information about the network performance, and
   about the level of synchronization between nodes.

   Timestamps can be spoofed or modified by on-path attackers, thus
   attacking the application that uses the timestamps.  For example, if
   timestamps are used in a delay measurement protocol, an attacker can
   modify en route timestamps in a way that manipulates the measurement
   results.  Integrity protection mechanisms, such as Hashed Message
   Authentication Codes (HMAC), can mitigate such attacks.  The
   specification of an integrity protection mechanism is outside the
   scope of this document, as typically integrity protection will be
   defined on a per-network-protocol basis, and not specifically for the
   timestamp field.

   Another potential threat that can have a similar impact is delay
   attacks.  An attacker can maliciously delay some or all of the en
   route messages, with the same harmful implications as described in
   the previous paragraph.  Mitigating delay attacks is a significant
   challenge; in contrast to spoofing and modification attacks, the
   delay attack cannot be prevented by cryptographic integrity
   protection mechanisms.  In some cases delay attacks can be mitigated
   by sending the timestamped information through multiple paths,
   allowing to detect and to be resilient to an attacker that has access
   to one of the paths.

   In many cases timestamping relies on an underlying synchronization
   mechanism.  Thus, any attack that compromises the synchronization
   mechanism can also compromise protocols that use timestamping.
   Attacks on time protocols are discussed in detail in [RFC7384].
