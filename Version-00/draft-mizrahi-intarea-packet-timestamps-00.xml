     <t>This document specifies guidelines for defining binary packet timestamp formats in networking protocols at various layers. It also presents three recommended timestamp formats. The target audience of this memo includes network protocol designers. It is expected that a new network protocol that requires a packet timestamp will, in most cases, use one of the recommended timestamp formats. If none of the recommended formats fits the protocol requirements, the new protocol specification should specify the format of the packet timestamp according to the guidelines in this document.</t>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>Timestamps are widely used in network protocols for various purposes, including delay measurement, clock synchronization, and logging or reporting the time of an event.</t>
	 
	 <t>Timestamps are represented in the RFC series in one of two forms: text-based timestamps, and packet timestamps. Text-based timestamps <xref target="RFC3339"></xref> are represented as user-friendly strings, and are widely used in the RFC series, for example in information objects and data models, e.g., <xref target="RFC5646"></xref>, <xref target="RFC6991"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC7493"></xref>. Packet timestamps, on the other hand, are represented by a compact binary field that has a fixed size, and are not intended to have a human-friendly format. Packet timestamps are also very common in the RFC series, and are used for example for measuring delay and for synchronizing clocks, e.g., <xref target="RFC5905"></xref>, <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC1323"></xref>.</t>

   <section anchor="format" title="Packet Timestamp Format Specification">

	<t>This section defines a template for specifying packet timestamp formats. A timestamp format specification MUST include the following aspects:</t>
	
     <t>Timestamp field format: <list
         hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>The format of the timestamp field consists of:</t>
		 <t>+ Size: The number of bits (or octets) used to represent the packet timestamp field.</t>
		 <t>+ Units: The units used to represent the timestamp.</t>
		 <t>If the timestamp is comprised of more than one field, the format of each field is specified.</t>
       </list></t>

     <t>Epoch: <list
         hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>The origin of the timescale used for the timestamp; the moment in time used as a reference for the timestamp value.</t>
       </list></t>

     <t>Wraparound: <list
         hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>The wraparound period of the timestamp. Any further wraparound-related considerations should be described here.</t>
       </list></t>
	   
     <t>Synchronization aspects: <list
         hangIndent="10" style="empty">
         <t>Any assumptions or requirements related to synchronization should be specified, for example, whether it is assumed that nodes populating the timestamps should be synchronized, and whether the timestamp is measured with respect to a central reference clock such as a stratum 1 NTP server.</t>
       </list></t>

   </section>


   <section title="Recommended Timestamp Formats">
	 <t>This memo recommends to use one of the three timestamp formats specified below. In cases where the three timestamp formats below do not satisfy the protocol requirements, the timestamp specification should clearly state the reasons for defining a new format.</t>
	 
	 <t>Clearly, different network protocols (and the use cases they serve) may have different requirements and constraints, and consequently may use different timestamp formats. The choice of the specific timestamp format for a given protocol may depend on a various factors. A few examples of factors that may affect the choice of the timestamp format:</t>

     <t><list style="symbols">
         <t>Timestamp size: while some network protocols may allow a large timestamp fields, in other cases there may be constraints with respect to the timestamp size, affecting the choice of the timestamp format.</t>

         <t>Resolution: the time resolution is another factor that may directly affect the selected timestamp format. Similarly, the wraparound periodicity of the timestamp may also affect the selected format.</t>

         <t>Common format for multiple protocols: if there are two or more network protocols that use timestamps and are often used together in typical systems, using a common timestamp format should be preferred if possible.</t>
	 </list></t>

	 
	 <section title="NTP Timestamp Formats">

     <section title="NTP 64-bit Timestamp Format">
	 
	 <t>The Network Time Protocol (NTP) 64-bit timestamp format is defined in <xref target="RFC5905"></xref>. This timestamp format is used in several network protocols, including <xref target="RFC6374"></xref>, <xref target="RFC4656"></xref>, and <xref target="RFC5357"></xref>. Since this timestamp format is used in NTP, this timestamp format should be preferred in network protocols that are typically deployed in concert with NTP.</t>
	 
	 <t>The format is presented in this section according to the template defined in <xref target="format"></xref>.</t>

	 <t>The Precision Time Protocol (PTP) <xref target="IEEE1588"></xref> uses an 80-bit timestamp format. The concatenated timestamp format is a 64-bit field, which is the 64 least significant bits of the 80-bit PTP timestamp.

   <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">

     <t>A network protocol that uses a packet timestamp MUST specify the security considerations that result from using the timestamp. This section provides an overview of some of the common security considerations of using timestamps.</t>
	 
	 <t>Any metadata that is attached to control or data packets, and specifically packet timestamps, can facilitate network reconnaissance; by passively eavesdropping to timestamped packets an attacker can gather information about the network performance, and about the level of synchronization between nodes.</t>

	 <t>Timestamps can be spoofed or modified by on-path attackers, thus attacking the application that uses the timestamps. For example, if timestamps are used in a delay measurement protocol, an attacker can modify en route timestamps in a way that manipulates the measurement results. Integrity protection mechanisms, such as Hashed Message Authentication Codes (HMAC), can mitigate such attacks. The specification of an integrity protection mechanism is outside the scope of this document, as typically integrity protection will be defined on a per-network-protocol basis, and not specifically for the timestamp field.</t>
	 
	 <t>Another potential threat that can have a similar impact is delay attacks. An attacker can maliciously delay some or all of the en route messages, with the same harmful implications as described in the previous paragraph. Mitigating delay attacks is a significant challenge; in contrast to spoofing and modification attacks, the delay attack cannot be prevented by cryptographic integrity protection mechanisms. In some cases delay attacks can be mitigated by sending the timestamped information through multiple paths, allowing to detect and to be resilient to an attacker that has access to one of the paths.</t>
	 
	 <t>In many cases timestamping relies on an underlying synchronization mechanism. Thus, any attack that compromises the synchronization mechanism can also compromise protocols that use timestamping. Attacks on time protocols are discussed in detail in <xref target="RFC7456"></xref>.</t>
